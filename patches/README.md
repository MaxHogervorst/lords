# Laravel 5.3 Patches for PHP 7.3 Compatibility

## Overview

These patches fix compatibility issues between Laravel 5.3 and PHP 7.3. Apply them after running `composer install`.

## Required Patches

### 1. laravel-5.3-php-7.3-fix.patch

**File**: `vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Builder.php`

**Issue**: PHP 7.3's strict `count()` function throws errors when attempting to count null values in Laravel's query scope system.

**Apply manually**:

```bash
# Line 1227
# Change:
$originalWhereCount = count($query->wheres);
# To:
$originalWhereCount = is_countable($query->wheres) ? count($query->wheres) : 0;

# Line 1273
# Change:
return count($query->wheres) > $originalWhereCount;
# To:
return is_countable($query->wheres) && count($query->wheres) > $originalWhereCount;
```

**Or apply using patch**:

```bash
patch -p1 < patches/laravel-5.3-php-7.3-fix.patch
```

## Why These Patches Are Needed

Laravel 5.3 was released before PHP 7.3's strict type requirements for `count()`. When Laravel 5.3 tries to count query scopes that haven't been initialized, PHP 7.3 throws:

```
ErrorException: count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable
```

This blocks all database queries that use Eloquent's `with()` or relationship loading.

## Verification

After applying patches, verify with:

```bash
docker-compose exec app vendor/bin/phpunit tests/InvoiceControllerTest.php
```

All tests should pass (except potentially 1 intermittent test related to session state).

## Future Considerations

When upgrading to Laravel 5.4+, these patches will no longer be needed as those versions have proper PHP 7.3+ compatibility.
