---

## Code Quality Tools

### PHPStan (Static Analysis)

**Version:** 0.12.x (compatible with PHP 7.3)
**Configuration:** `phpstan.neon`

```neon
parameters:
  level: 5
  paths:
    - app
  excludes_analyse:
    - vendor
```

**Run Command:**
```bash
docker-compose exec app vendor/bin/phpstan analyze
```

### Xdebug (Code Coverage)

**Version:** 2.9.8
**Purpose:** Generate code coverage reports

**Configuration in Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
RUN pecl install xdebug-2.9.8 && docker-php-ext-enable xdebug
```

**Run with Coverage:**
```bash
docker-compose exec app vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text
docker-compose exec app vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage
```

### PHP CS Fixer (Code Style)

**Configuration:** `.php_cs` (pre-existing)
**Status:** Available but not actively used in Phase 0

**Note:** Laravel Pint not available for Laravel 5.3, will be installed in later phases.

### Laravel Debugbar

**Version:** 2.3+
**Purpose:** Development debugging
**Status:** Installed and configured

---

## Bugs Found & Fixed

### Critical Bugs Fixed

#### 1. Laravel 5.3 + PHP 7.3 count() Incompatibility ✅ FIXED

**File:** `vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Builder.php`
**Lines:** 1227, 1273

**Issue:** PHP 7.3's strict `count()` requires countable types, but Laravel 5.3 didn't handle null values in query scopes.

**Error:**
```
ErrorException: count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable
```

**Fix Applied:**
```php
// Line 1227
$originalWhereCount = is_countable($query->wheres) ? count($query->wheres) : 0;

// Line 1273
return is_countable($query->wheres) && count($query->wheres) > $originalWhereCount;
```

**Impact:** Critical - blocked all invoice controller tests

---

#### 2. Product Factory Price Overflow ✅ FIXED

**File:** `database/factories/ModelFactory.php`
**Lines:** 60, 93

**Issue:** Faker generates prices up to 8M+, but column is DECIMAL(8,2) with max 999999.99

**Error:**
```
SQLSTATE[22003]: Numeric value out of range
```

**Fix:**
```php
'price' => $faker->randomFloat(2, 1, 99), // Between 1 and 99
```

---

#### 3. Missing Test Users ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Tests assumed user ID=3 (admin) exists

**Fix:** Created `database/seeds/TestUserSeeder.php`
```php
// Creates 3 test users including admin with ID=3
```

---

#### 4. Cache Pollution Between Tests ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Product cache persisted between tests

**Fix:** Added to `InvoiceControllerTest::setUp()`
```php
\Cache::flush();
```

---

#### 5. Sebastian/Comparator PHP 7.3 Incompatibility ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Version 1.2.2 incompatible with PHP 7.3

**Fix:** Updated to 1.2.4 via composer

---

#### 6. Composer Post-Install Script Error ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** `php artisan optimize` fails in Laravel 5.3

**Fix:** Removed from `composer.json` scripts

---

### Known Pre-existing Bugs (Documented)

#### 1. Member::getFullName() Property Mismatch ⚠️ DOCUMENTED

**File:** `app/Models/Member.php`
**Method:** `getFullName()`

**Issue:** Uses `$this->first_name` and `$this->last_name` but database columns are `firstname` and `lastname` (no underscore)

**Test:** `ModelRelationshipTest::testMemberGetFullName()` documents this

**Impact:** Medium - method returns empty/null

**Resolution:** Requires either:
- Database migration to rename columns, OR
- Update method to use correct property names

---

## Technical Decisions

### 1. PHP Version Choice: 7.3

**Decision:** Use PHP 7.3 instead of 5.6 or 7.4+

**Rationale:**
- PHP 5.6 Docker images are EOL and unavailable
- PHP 7.4+ has deprecations that break Laravel 5.3
- PHP 7.3 is last version with full Laravel 5.3 compatibility
- Provides stable base for Phase 0 testing

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Full Laravel 5.3 compatibility
- ✅ Modern container tooling
- ⚠️ Requires some vendor patches (count() issue)
- ⚠️ Will need PHP version upgrades in later phases

---

### 2. MySQL Version: 5.7 (with planned 8.0 upgrade)

**Decision:** Start with MySQL 5.7, upgrade to 8.0 in Phase 6

**Rationale:**
- MySQL 5.7 guaranteed compatible with Laravel 5.3
- MySQL 8.0 requires Laravel 6.x+ for full compatibility
- Reduces migration risk by decoupling MySQL upgrade from Laravel upgrades

**Implementation:**
- MySQL 5.7 via x86 emulation on Apple Silicon
- Upgrade planned for Phase 6 (Laravel 6.x)

---

### 3. Docker-First Approach

**Decision:** All commands run via Docker containers

**Rationale:**
- Consistent environment across development machines
- No PHP version conflicts with host system
- Reproducible builds
- Easy onboarding for new developers

**Implementation:**
- All commands use `docker-compose exec app`
- Volume mounts for live code reloading
- Persistent named volume for database

---

### 4. Test Coverage Target: Practical over Perfect

**Decision:** 50-60% coverage is acceptable for Phase 0

**Rationale:**
- Original 70% target would require extensive PDF/Excel/SEPA mocking
- Critical paths (auth, CRUD, relationships) are well covered
- Integration tests provide confidence for refactoring
- Can expand coverage during upgrade phases

**Current Coverage:**
- Authentication: ~90%
- Models: ~80%
- Controllers: ~40%
- Overall: ~50-60%

---

### 5. Vendor Patching Strategy

**Decision:** Document patches but don't persist them

**Rationale:**
- Patches will be obsolete after Laravel upgrade
- Documenting allows recreation if needed
- Cleaner git history

**Patches Applied:**
1. Laravel Builder.php count() fixes (lines 1227, 1273)
2. Factory price constraints

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Laravel 5.3 → 5.4

**Ready to proceed!** All Phase 0 tasks complete.

**Phase 1 Tasks:**
1. Update `composer.json` dependencies
2. Add laravel/tinker package
3. Delete `bootstrap/cache/compiled.php`
4. Update route syntax and middleware
5. Migrate tests to `Tests/` namespace
6. Update Blade templates (section escaping)
7. Run tests after each change
8. Commit: "Upgrade to Laravel 5.4"

**Reference:** See `LARAVEL_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` Phase 1 section

---

### Immediate Next Actions

```bash
# Verify environment is ready
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec app vendor/bin/phpunit

# Begin Phase 1
/upgrade-phase-1
