# Phase 12: Laravel 12.x Upgrade - DEFERRED

## Status: **Deferred until after Phase 13**

## Reason

Laravel 12.x upgrade has been **temporarily deferred** due to ecosystem dependency constraints:

### Blocking Issue

**cartalyst/sentinel** (authentication package) compatibility:
- Current version: `v8.0.0` (supports Laravel 11)
- Latest version: `v9.0.0` (requires PHP ^8.3 + Laravel 12)
- Our current PHP: `8.2.29`

### Dependency Chain

```
Laravel 12 → requires illuminate/support ^12.0
Sentinel v9 → requires illuminate/support ^12.0 + PHP ^8.3
Current PHP → 8.2.29 (doesn't meet PHP ^8.3 requirement)
```

## Solution Path

**Optimal upgrade sequence:**

1. ✅ **Phases 0-11**: Complete (Laravel 5.3 → 11.x, PHP 7.3 → 8.2)
2. ⏭️ **Phase 12**: Deferred (Laravel 11 → 12)
3. ⏩ **Phase 13**: Next (PHP 8.2 → 8.4) ← **DO THIS FIRST**
4. 🔄 **Phase 12**: Retry (Laravel 11 → 12) ← **THEN RETURN HERE**

## Why This Order?

1. **PHP 8.4 enables Laravel 12**: Once on PHP 8.4, we can upgrade Sentinel v9 and Laravel 12
2. **Ecosystem maturity**: More packages will have Laravel 12 support after PHP upgrade
3. **Single breaking change**: Upgrading PHP first, then Laravel avoids double breakage

## What Was Attempted

### Composer.json Changes Tried
```json
{
  "require": {
    "laravel/framework": "^12.0",  // ❌ Blocked by Sentinel
    "laravel/tinker": "^2.10",
    "cartalyst/sentinel": "^8.0"    // ❌ Only supports Laravel 11
  },
  "require-dev": {
    "spatie/laravel-ignition": "^2.4"  // ✅ Compatible
  }
}
```

### Composer Error
```
cartalyst/sentinel v8.0.0 requires illuminate/support ^11.0
laravel/framework ^12.0 requires illuminate/support ^12.0
→ Conflict: Cannot install both
```

## When to Retry Phase 12

**After completing Phase 13**, retry Phase 12 with:

```bash
# Update composer.json
"php": "^8.4",
"laravel/framework": "^12.0",
"cartalyst/sentinel": "^9.0",  # Now compatible!

# Then run
composer update -W
```

## Current State

- ✅ Laravel: `11.46.1` (stable, working)
- ✅ PHP: `8.2.29` (ready for 8.4 upgrade)
- ✅ All tests: Passing
- ✅ Application: Fully functional

## Next Steps

Run `/upgrade-phase-13` to upgrade PHP 8.2 → 8.4

---

**Documentation Date**: 2025-10-02
**Laravel Version**: 11.46.1
**PHP Version**: 8.2.29
**Decision**: Defer Phase 12, proceed to Phase 13
